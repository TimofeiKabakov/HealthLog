Recipies

maintained by us
each recipie "object" keeps track of its own calories, protein, carb, fat, vitamins
theres like a cook button and if you click it it gets put to your calories for that day
do we want to make it so the user can adjust the amount of an item so that when the cook it it will more accurately reflect that in their calorie count, sometimes when im cooking the recipie will ask for like 800 grams of chicken but its easier to add like 1kg, or at the store the closest package is like 700 grams
